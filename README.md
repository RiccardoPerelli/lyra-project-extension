Extension of the Lyra project in unreal engine

# A couple of word about .gitignore and .gitattributes

For the .gitignore file, it's recommended to ignore files that are generated by the engine or by the build process. This includes files such as intermediate build files, logs, and compiled binaries.
For example, we will ignore the "Intermediate/" or "Binaries/" folders.

For the .gitattributes file, it's recommended to use Git LFS (Large File Storage) to manage large binary assets, such as textures, audio files, and 3D models. This can help to reduce the size of the repository and improve performance.
